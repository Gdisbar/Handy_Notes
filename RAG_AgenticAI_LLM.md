## Part 1: Concept Review Notes

### 1. Transformer & DL Fundamentals (the part you shouldn't skip)

These show up disguised inside RAG/agent questions even though they're "ML topics," so a fast refresher matters.

**Self-attention**: each token forms a Query, Key, Value vector. Attention score = softmax(QKᵀ/√dₖ). The √dₖ scaling prevents large dot products from pushing softmax into saturated, near-zero-gradient regions when dimensionality is high.

**Multi-head attention**: splitting Q/K/V into multiple heads lets the model attend to different relational subspaces simultaneously (e.g., syntactic vs. coreference patterns) rather than averaging everything into one representation.

**Positional encoding**: transformers have no inherent sequence order, so sinusoidal or learned/rotary (RoPE) position information is injected. RoPE matters in interview questions because it's what most modern long-context LLMs (Llama, Mistral, Qwen) use, and it generalizes better to unseen sequence lengths than absolute positional embeddings.

**Context window limits**: quadratic cost of self-attention (O(n²) in sequence length) is *why* RAG exists at all — it's cheaper to retrieve 5 relevant chunks than to stuff 500 pages into context.

**KV cache**: during autoregressive generation, key/value projections for already-generated tokens are cached so each new token doesn't recompute attention over the full history. This is the main lever in inference latency/throughput optimization (and the reason long contexts are expensive in production: cache size grows linearly with tokens × layers × heads).

**Decoding strategies**: greedy (deterministic, repetitive), beam search (better quality, expensive, used rarely for chat), temperature/top-k/top-p sampling (controls randomness/diversity). Interview questions often probe *when low temperature is wrong* — e.g., it can cause repetition loops in long generations, not just "more deterministic."

### 2. RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation)

**Why RAG**: grounds generation in external, current, or proprietary data without retraining; reduces (but does not eliminate) hallucination; cheaper and faster to update than fine-tuning when facts change frequently.

**Pipeline stages**: ingestion → chunking → embedding → indexing (vector store) → query embedding → retrieval (top-k similarity/ANN search) → optional re-ranking → context assembly → generation.

**Chunking strategy** is the single most-tested RAG concept:
- Fixed-size chunking (e.g., 512 tokens) is simple but can split sentences/concepts mid-thought.
- Semantic/recursive chunking splits on natural boundaries (paragraphs, headers) — better retrieval precision, costs more preprocessing.
- Overlap (e.g., 10–20%) between chunks prevents losing context at chunk boundaries — expect a question testing *why* overlap exists.
- Chunk size trade-off: smaller chunks → more precise retrieval but less context per chunk and more chunks needed; larger chunks → richer context but noisier/less precise matches and fewer chunks fit in the context window.

**Embedding models**: dense embeddings (e.g., from a bi-encoder) capture semantic similarity but can miss exact keyword/entity matches (a known weakness for proper nouns, IDs, codes). This is why **hybrid search** (dense + sparse/BM25) is a recurring "best practice" answer in MCQs — it covers both semantic and lexical matching.

**Re-ranking**: a cross-encoder re-ranker scores (query, chunk) pairs jointly *after* initial retrieval — more accurate than bi-encoder similarity alone but too expensive to run over the whole corpus, so it's applied only to the top-k candidates. Expect a question contrasting bi-encoder (fast, used for retrieval) vs. cross-encoder (slow, accurate, used for re-ranking).

**Retrieval failure modes** (commonly tested as "diagnose the issue" questions):
- *Low recall*: relevant chunk never retrieved → usually a chunking or embedding-model mismatch issue.
- *High recall, low precision*: relevant chunk retrieved but buried among noise → re-ranking or top-k tuning issue.
- *Stale answers*: index not refreshed after source documents change → an indexing/pipeline freshness problem, not a model problem.
- *Hallucination despite correct retrieval*: the LLM ignores or contradicts retrieved context — a prompt/grounding instruction issue, addressed via stricter system prompts ("answer only from context") or citation-forcing.

**Evaluation metrics specific to RAG**:
- Retrieval: Recall@k, Precision@k, MRR (Mean Reciprocal Rank).
- Generation: faithfulness/groundedness (does the answer follow from retrieved context?), answer relevance, context relevance. Frameworks like RAGAS formalize these. A common trick question: a model can be *fluent and relevant* but *not faithful* (i.e., it hallucinates on top of correct retrieval) — these are independent axes, not one score.

**Advanced RAG patterns** likely to appear at "Difficult" level: query rewriting/expansion (reformulating vague user queries before retrieval), HyDE (generating a hypothetical answer first, then embedding *that* for retrieval — improves recall when query and document phrasing differ a lot), multi-hop/iterative retrieval for questions needing several pieces of evidence, and parent-child chunk retrieval (retrieve small chunks for precision, return the larger parent chunk for context).

### 3. Agentic AI

**Core definition**: an LLM agent perceives state, reasons about a goal, selects and invokes tools/actions, observes results, and iterates — as opposed to a single-shot prompt→response system.

**ReAct pattern** (Reason + Act): the model interleaves explicit reasoning traces with tool calls and observations in a loop, instead of either pure chain-of-thought (no tools) or pure tool-calling (no visible reasoning). Expect a question distinguishing ReAct from plain chain-of-thought prompting.

**Planning approaches**: 
- Single-step (decide next action only, re-plan after each observation) — robust to surprises, slower.
- Plan-and-execute (decompose the full task upfront into subtasks, then execute) — faster for well-understood tasks, brittle if early assumptions are wrong since the whole plan may need redoing.

**Tool use / function calling**: the LLM outputs a structured call (tool name + arguments, typically JSON) which the orchestration layer executes; the result is fed back into context. Key failure mode tested: the model hallucinating a tool that doesn't exist or passing malformed arguments — mitigated by strict schema validation and constrained decoding/JSON mode.

**Memory in agents**:
- Short-term/working memory = the current context window (conversation + recent tool results).
- Long-term memory = external store (vector DB, key-value store, or summarized history) that persists across sessions and is retrieved when relevant — essentially RAG applied to the agent's own history.
- A common exam-style question: when context grows too large, do you truncate, summarize, or retrieve selectively? Summarization loses detail; selective retrieval (treating memory as a RAG problem) is usually the "best" answer for long-running agents.

**Multi-agent systems**: decompose a task across specialized agents (e.g., planner, researcher, coder, critic) coordinated by an orchestrator. Trade-off tested: multi-agent systems improve task decomposition and specialization but add latency, cost, and coordination/failure-propagation risk compared to a single capable agent.

**Guardrails & reliability**: agents are riskier than single-turn chat because actions can have side effects (sending emails, executing code, making purchases). Production patterns: human-in-the-loop approval for high-risk actions, sandboxing tool execution, rate-limiting/looping detection (an agent stuck repeating the same failed action), and explicit "stop conditions" (max iterations, confidence thresholds).

**Evaluation of agents**: task success rate, number of steps/tool calls to completion (efficiency), and groundedness of intermediate reasoning — harder to evaluate than single-turn QA because errors can compound across steps (a small early mistake derails the whole trajectory).

### 4. LLM Production & MLOps for Language Systems

**Prompt engineering vs. fine-tuning vs. RAG** — a classic "when would you use X" question:
- Prompting/few-shot: fastest, no training cost, best for format/behavior control with knowledge the base model already has.
- RAG: best when the need is *current or proprietary facts*, not behavior change.
- Fine-tuning (incl. LoRA/PEFT): best when you need to change *style, format reliability, or domain reasoning patterns* the base model doesn't do well even with good prompts — not primarily a fix for "the model doesn't know this fact" (that's RAG's job).

**Hallucination**: model generates fluent but factually unsupported content. Mitigations tested: RAG grounding, lower temperature, requiring citations to source chunks, output verification/self-consistency checks, and fine-tuning on "I don't know" examples for unanswerable questions.

**Latency/cost levers in production**: smaller/distilled models for simple sub-tasks (model routing), caching frequent queries/responses, streaming tokens to reduce perceived latency, batching requests, and reducing prompt size (compressed context, fewer few-shot examples) since cost and latency scale with token count.

**Monitoring an LLM/RAG system in production**: track retrieval quality drift (are retrieved chunks still relevant as the corpus or query distribution shifts?), output quality (via sampled human eval or LLM-as-judge), latency/cost per request, and safety metrics (toxic/unsafe output rate, prompt injection attempts). This mirrors the "feature store / null rate / schema check" monitoring concepts from your report, just applied to text pipelines instead of tabular features.

**Prompt injection & security**: untrusted content retrieved by RAG or browsed by an agent can contain instructions trying to hijack the model ("ignore previous instructions..."). Standard mitigation: treat retrieved/tool content as data, not instructions — enforce this via system-prompt structure and, where possible, input/output filtering, not by hoping the model resists it.

**Evaluation at the system level**: LLM-as-judge (using a strong model to score outputs against rubrics) scales better than full human eval but has known biases (favoring verbose answers, position bias in comparisons) — a frequent "what's the limitation of this approach" question.

## Answer Key & Explanations

**Q1: B.** Relevant retrieval but unsupported claims in the final answer is specifically a faithfulness/groundedness failure — retrieval and generation quality are independent axes; this isn't a recall or indexing issue since the right chunks *were* found.

**Q2: B.** Without the √dₖ scaling, dot products grow large in expectation as dimensionality increases, pushing softmax outputs toward 0/1 extremes and killing gradient flow.

**Q3: C.** Dense embeddings are weak on exact identifiers/codes; hybrid search adds sparse/keyword matching (BM25) to catch exact matches dense retrieval misses. Bigger embedding models or more overlap don't fix the lexical-matching gap.

**Q4: B.** Cross-encoders process the query and document together through the full model for each pair — accurate but O(n) expensive per query, so they're reserved for re-ranking a small candidate set, not full-corpus search.

**Q5: B.** Queries are often short and phrased differently from the documents that answer them; a hypothetical answer is stylistically closer to the target documents, so embedding it (instead of the raw query) improves semantic match — even though the hypothetical content itself may be factually wrong, its *phrasing* helps retrieval.

**Q6: B.** Plan-and-execute commits to a full plan upfront, which is efficient when assumptions hold but means the whole plan may need redoing if an early step's assumption was wrong — unlike single-step agents which re-plan after every observation.

**Q7: B.** ReAct's defining feature is interleaving reasoning ("Thought") with concrete actions and observations in a loop, distinguishing it from chain-of-thought (reasoning only, no actions) and from pure tool-calling (actions only, no visible reasoning).

**Q8: C.** Treating long-term agent memory as a retrieval problem (store everything, retrieve what's relevant per step) preserves detail better than blind truncation (loses old info) or single-summary compression (loses specificity).

**Q9: B.** Fine-tuning bakes knowledge into weights approximately and requires retraining for every update — bad fit for frequently changing facts. RAG retrieves current facts at query time without retraining.

**Q10: A.** Growing average prompt/context length (e.g., accumulating conversation history, larger retrieved context) directly drives up both token cost and latency; it's the most common and easiest-to-check root cause before suspecting model or embedding-level issues.

**Q11: B.** This is the standard trade-off: better decomposition and specialization at the cost of added latency, cost, and the risk that one agent's error propagates/compounds through the pipeline.

**Q12: B.** This is the textbook definition of prompt injection delivered through untrusted retrieved/tool content — the system should treat such content as data, not as instructions to follow.

**Q13: B.** LLM-as-judge scales evaluation well but has documented biases (verbosity bias, position bias in pairwise comparisons, self-preference bias) that must be controlled for (e.g., randomizing order, controlling length).

**Q14: B.** KV caching stores previously computed key/value tensors so each new generated token only computes attention for the new position, not the whole sequence again — this is the primary inference-speed optimization in autoregressive decoding.

**Q15: B.** Single-hop retrieval only surfaces one relevant chunk per query; answering questions requiring synthesis across multiple documents needs multi-hop/iterative retrieval (retrieve, reason, retrieve again) or query decomposition.

## Suggested Next Step

If you'd like, I can generate a second, harder set focused purely on architecture/system-design style questions (e.g., "design a RAG system for X constraints" or "debug this agent failure trace"), since those tend to be the differentiator at Senior level beyond definitional MCQs.
